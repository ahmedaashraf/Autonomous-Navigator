# Development Approach

## Project Overview

The project involves adding a new controller to an existing application for managing user data and related entities (emails, phone numbers, addresses, locations, and files) using the Repository Pattern. This approach enhances code maintainability and separation of concerns.

## Approach

### 1. **Project Analysis:**
   - Analyze the existing project structure and architecture to understand its components, dependencies, and integration points.

### 2. **Define Entity Classes:**
   - Define entity classes based on the provided class diagram.
   - Ensure that entity classes align with the existing data model.

### 3. **Repository Pattern:**
   - Implement the Repository Pattern to encapsulate data access operations.
   - Create a repository interface outlining CRUD methods for each entity.
   - Develop a concrete repository class that implements this interface.

### 4. **Business Logic Layer:**
   - Implement business logic services to handle complex operations or business-specific rules.
   - Services should leverage repositories to perform data operations.

### 5. **Database Integration:**
   - Configure Entity Framework Core to facilitate data persistence.
   - Define database contexts and migrations to establish database tables.
   - Configure entity relationships, if applicable (e.g., one-to-many).

### 6. **Controller Integration:**
   - Add a new controller to the existing project for the new functionality.
   - Ensure the controller interacts with the business logic layer and repositories as needed.

### 7. **Dependency Management:**
   - Utilize the existing dependency injection framework to manage dependencies.
   - Register the new controller, repositories, and services in the dependency injection container.

### 8. **Documentation and Testing:**
   - Document the new API endpoints for clear usage instructions.
   - Implement unit tests and integration tests to validate the new controller's functionality.

### 9. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Integrate with auth0 to check for JWT tokens.

### 10. **Error Handling and Logging:**
    - Ensure that the new controller implements error handling to gracefully manage exceptions and unexpected behaviors.
    - Leverage the existing logging mechanism to monitor application health.

### 12. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
    - TBD with the team . Sentry is an option .

### 13. **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing:**
    - Update the project's documentation to include the new controller and its integration points.
    - Share knowledge about the changes with the team members to ensure seamless collaboration.
